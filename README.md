## Features

- Schedule PR merges using natural datetime format
- Supports all IANA timezone names (defaults to UTC)
- Uses 24-hour format if AM/PM not specified
- Automatic merge conflict detection
- Clear feedback via PR comments
- Easy cancellation and rescheduling
- Maximum scheduling window of 30 days

## Setup

1. Create `.github/workflows/pr-merge-scheduler.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: PR Merge Scheduler

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *'

jobs:
  process-schedule:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
      contents: write
      issues: write
    steps:
      - uses: markshust/pr-merge-scheduler@main
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          mode: ${{ github.event_name == 'issue_comment' && 'comment' || 'scheduler' }}
          comment-body: ${{ github.event.comment.body }}
          pr-number: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
          repository: ${{ github.repository }}
```

## Usage

### Scheduling a Merge

Comment on any PR with:

```
@merge-at YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm[am|pm] [timezone]
```

Examples:
```
@merge-at 2024-01-01 14:30
@merge-at 2024-01-01 02:30PM America/New_York
@merge-at 2024-12-25 09:00 Europe/London
```

The action will respond with a confirmation comment showing both the local time and UTC time of the scheduled merge.

### Cancelling a Scheduled Merge

To cancel a scheduled merge, comment:
```
@merge-at cancel
```

### Rescheduling

To change the merge time, simply post a new `@merge-at` command. The most recent command always takes precedence.

## Time Format Rules

- If AM/PM is not specified, 24-hour format is assumed
- If timezone is not specified, UTC is used
- Date must be in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Time must be in HH:mm format
- Cannot schedule more than 30 days in advance
- Must schedule for a future time

## Supported Timezones

Supports all IANA timezone names (e.g., 'America/New_York', 'Europe/London', 'Asia/Tokyo'). 
See [full list of timezone names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

## Costs

### GitHub Actions Minutes Usage

This action runs on a schedule to check for PRs that are ready to be merged. The scheduled runtime impacts your GitHub Actions minutes usage:

**Hourly Schedule (Recommended)**
- 1 run per hour √ó 24 hours √ó 30 days = 720 minutes/month
- Uses standard Linux runners (1√ó multiplier)
- Monthly usage:
   - ~36% of Free tier minutes (2,000 included)
   - ~24% of Team tier minutes (3,000 included)
   - No overage costs on any tier

This recommended hourly schedule:
- Stays well within free tier limits
- Leaves plenty of minutes for other workflows
- Has zero overage costs
- Provides reasonable scheduling granularity (PRs merge within ~1 hour of scheduled time)

Note: GitHub rounds each workflow run up to the nearest minute, even if the actual execution time is shorter. Usage is calculated based on this rounding.

## Error Handling

The action will comment on the PR if:
- The command format is invalid
- The specified time is in the past
- The specified time is too far in the future
- The timezone is invalid
- The PR cannot be merged due to conflicts
- Any other issues occur during the merge process

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x
- npm

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/pr-merge-scheduler.git
cd pr-merge-scheduler
npm install
```

### Building

```bash
npm run build
```

### Testing

```bash
npm test
```

### Linting

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests: `npm test`
5. Build: `npm run build`
6. Commit including the `dist` directory

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Security

This action requires `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write` permissions to function. It uses GitHub's built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` and doesn't require any additional secrets.

## Limitations

- Maximum schedule window is 30 days
- Requires appropriate permissions to merge PRs
- Schedule is lost if the PR is updated (new commits pushed)
- GitHub Actions runner must be available at the scheduled time

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Merge Failed**
   - Check if the branch is up to date
   - Verify there are no merge conflicts
   - Ensure branch protection rules are satisfied

2. **Invalid Command**
   - Verify the date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Verify the time format (HH:mm or HH:mmAM/PM)
   - Check if the timezone name is valid

3. **Permissions**
   - Ensure the workflow has necessary permissions
   - Verify the user has permission to merge PRs
